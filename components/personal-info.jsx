        I am coming straight from the service business and my eye as a developer
        is focused on the not-so-used-to-this-tehnology-stuff-people.
        <br />I myself have been struggeling, not just one or two times, with
        trying to understand what a site or app wants from ME - and my goal is
        to make sure that no one needs to ask themselves that.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3 text-purple font-bold">
        My focus will always be too create a user friendly site/app prior to a
        super fancy one - but of course I do not mind adding some extra flavour to
        it.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        I am still trying to discover my place in this (for me) new found world,
        and I would love it if you would like to help me with this, so that I
        too can find a place where I can grow and flourish - both as a developer
        but also as a person.
